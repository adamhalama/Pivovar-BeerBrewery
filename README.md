# Beer brewery

Scource code for beer brewery development

This product allows to specify an exact beer recipe directly on the physical interface that has been built for this specific use case. The program is written using C and is running on a Raspberry Pi 3, itâ€™s I/O pins were programmed for regulating the temperatures, and for connection to the physical interface. This was my first programming experience, which I had gone through myself without any course or a teacher helping me. It helped me a lot with realizing good and bad coding practices and I had developed good programming thinking.
With this project I also competed in the national student contest in the category Electrical Engineering, Electronics and Telecommunication.

This software relies on customly bult & configured hardware for Raspberry Pi
